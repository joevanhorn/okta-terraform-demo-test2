## 🎯 When to Use

### Manual Validation Plan

Use the manual validation plan when:
- Setting up the repository for the first time
- **After deploying AWS backend infrastructure**
- After major changes to workflows or scripts
- Before deploying to production
- Troubleshooting issues
- Training new team members
- Periodic quality assurance (quarterly/biannually)
- **Validating state locking and S3 backend**

### Demo Build Guides

**Two guides available for different needs:**

**[Detailed Demo Build Guide](./DETAILED_DEMO_BUILD_GUIDE.md)** - Use when:
- Learning Terraform from scratch (zero experience)
- Onboarding new solutions engineers
- Understanding Infrastructure as Code deeply
- Building demo environments step-by-step
- **Setting up AWS backend for team collaboration**
- Training team members on GitOps workflows

**[Simple Demo Build Guide](../SIMPLE_DEMO_BUILD_GUIDE.md)** - Use when:
- Creating demos quickly (already completed QUICKSTART)
- Using AI-assisted code generation
- Building customer-facing demos rapidly
- Need demos ready in 30-45 minutes

## 🔄 Test Execution Tracking

Create a copy of the validation plan for each test run:

```bash
# Create dated copy for test run
cp MANUAL_VALIDATION_PLAN.md validation_run_$(date +%Y%m%d).md

# Fill out checklist items as you test
# Keep completed validation runs for audit trail
```
